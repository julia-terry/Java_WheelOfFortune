# Java_WheelOfFortune
This is a Java project made in NetBeans that allows a user to play Wheel of Fortune with as many people for as many rounds as they would like. They can also add your own phrase or one will randomly be selected from a generated list. 

#### Rules
<pre>
  • Each player gets to spin the wheel to get a dollar amount, lose a turn, go bankrupt, or have a chance to win a prize
  • Each player then gets to guess a letter. If that letter is in the phrase, the player will get the amount from the wheel for each occurence of the letter
  • If you have found a letter, you will also get a chance to guess at the phrase
  • Each player only has three guesses, once you have used up your three guesses, you can still guess letters, but no longer solve the puzzle
